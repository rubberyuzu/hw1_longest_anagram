longest_anagram
===============

This is my assignment for the summer internship.
===============
THE PROBLEM
Write a program that, given 16 characters, finds the longest possible word that can be made from those characters without trying all 2^16 possible sets of letters.
===============
IMPORTANT NOTE TO CODE REVIEWERS

I have three versions of programs, "anagram_newest.rb"(which is not the newest), "anagram_OOP.rb" and "activerecord".

I coded everything in Ruby. I am planning to re-code them in Python later in this internship period.

Since I had a problem loading the dictionary given, I used the dictionary in my computer. I have the text file based on my dictionary in the necessary folders, so you will be able to run all three programs without trouble.

Thanks for the code review, and I appreciate any kind of feedback!
